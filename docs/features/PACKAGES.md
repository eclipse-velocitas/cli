# Packages and components

Packages managed by the CLI are simply git repositories with a `manifest.json` at their root.

The manifest simply contains one field called `components` which holds a list of all components located inside of the package.

Example:
```json
{
    "components": [
        {
            "id": "component-A"
            ...
        },
        {
            "id": "component-B"
            ...
        }
    ]
}

```

# Component

A component is a collection of programs or files that serve a similar purpose or are inheritly connected. I.e. they provide a single runtime, a deployment for a runtime or add workflows required for Github.

```json
{
    "id": "component-A",
    "files": [
        {
            "src": "./src/github/workflows",
            "dst": ".github/workflows"
        }
    ],
    "programs": [

    ]
}
```

## `id` - string

The unique identifier of the component. Must be unique across **all** installed packages.

## `files` - Array[[`FileSpec`](#filespec)]

A list of file specifications to copy from the component to the project when calling the `sync` command.

## `programs` - Array[[`ProgramSpec`](#programspec)]

List of all programs exposed by the component.

## `onPostInit` - Array[[`ExecSpec`](#execspec)]

List of program references to be executed in-order after the component has been initialized.

## `variables` - Array[[`VariableDefinition`](#variabledefinition)]

List of variables exposed by this component.

# Types
## `FileSpec`

Specifies what to copy where when executing `sync`.

A file specification looks like this:
```json
{
    "src": "<source_path>",
    "dst": "<destionation_path>",
    "condition": "${{ foo }} === 'bar'"
}
```

### `src` - string

The source path of the file or directory to copy, relative to the repository root of the package repo. Supports in-string variable replacements.

### `dst` - string

The destination path of the file or directory to copy to, relative to the _Velocitas_ project's workspace. Supports in-string variable replacements.

### `condition` - string

An optional condition. Can be omitted to always copy the file(s). Needs to be a valid JavaScript condition expression. Supports in-string variable replacements.

Examples:
* Always copy all files from `<package_repo>/my_sync_files` to `<project_dir>/.github`:
```json
{
    "src": "./my_sync_files",
    "dst": "./.github"
}
```
* Conditionally copy all files from `<package_repo>/python_files` to `<project_dir>/`, if the project variable `language` is set to the string value `python`:
```json
{
    "src": "./python_files",
    "dst": ".",
    "condition": "${{ language }} === 'python'"
}
```
* Copy all files from the configured language directory `<package_repo>/${{ language }}_files` to `<project_dir>/`:
```json
{
    "src": "./${{ language }}_files",
    "dst": "."
}
```

## `ProgramSpec`

Specifies a program exposed by a component and its default parameters when invoked without arguments.

```json
{
    "id": "my-program",
    "executable": "./src/my_script.sh",
    "args": ["hello", "world"]
}
```

### `id` - string

Unique ID within this component to identify the program.

### `executable` - string

Either a relative path from the package's repository root to a script to execute (i.e. a Bash script) or a program reference available in the system (i.e. `python3` or `/usr/lib/python3`)

### `args` - Array[string]

A list of default arguments when invoking the program without parameters. This is required for Python scripts where `executable` will be just `python` and the first argument needs to be the path to the script.

## `ExecSpec`

An execution specification for one of the exposed programs via [`ProgramSpec`](#programspec). Used to invoke programs by the CLI when **not** using the `exec` command.

```json
{
    "ref": "my-program",
    "args": ["hello", "world"]
}
```

### `ref` - string

Reference to the program spec to invoke.

### `args` - Array[string]

A list of arguments which overwrite the arguments in `ProgramSpec.args`.

## `VariableDefinition`

Defines a variable exposed by a component.

```json
{
    "name": "repoUrl",
    "description": "The URL of the remote repository of this vehicle app.",
    "type": "string"
}
```

### `name` - string

The name of the variable.

### `description` - string

A description of the meaning of the variable.

### `type` - string

The type name of the variable. May be any valid JavaScript type.

### `default`: any?

Optional default value. If the default is omitted, the require becomes a required variable.
