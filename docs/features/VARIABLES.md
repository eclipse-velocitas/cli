# Variables

The CLI exposes variables to files copied via the `files` entry in a component manifest, the `condition` field of a file specification inside of the `files` entry and programs executed via the `exec` command. These variables are either built-in or are exposed by your project's components located in your project's packages.

Which variables are available from your packages can be viewed by the `packages` command which lists all of your installed packages and their exposed variables.

<strong>Notice:</strong> Variables exposed by a component are only valid within the scope of that component! In more practical terms: If you have a component A which exposes a string variable <i>hello</i>, <i>hello</i> will not be available to any files or programs exposed by component B.
