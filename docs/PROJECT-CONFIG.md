# Project configuration

The project configuration describes which packages your project is using and in which version. The versions of the referenced packages can be upgraded using the `upgrade` command. If you only want to see which new versions are available use `upgrade --dry-run`. Each package may expose variables which need to be set from the project configuration. If multiple different packages all expose the same named variable `foo`, setting this variable once in the project configuration will pass the value to all packages.

Read more about variables [here](./features/VARIABLES.md).

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "repo": "package-A",
      "version": "v1.0.0"
    },
    {
      "repo": "package-B",
      "version": "v2.3.1-dev"
    }
  ],
  "variables": {
    "repoUrl": "https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/cli",
    "copyrightYear": 2023,
    "autoGenerateVehicleModel": true
  }
}
```

## Components

A package always exposes 1 to n *components* each of which should provide distinct functionality, i.e. to set up a devContainer or to integrate with Github.

By default, all components of a package will be used, but if desired the used components can be filtered. By providing a list of component configurations in the project configuration:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "repo": "package-A",
      "version": "v1.0.0"
    },
    {
      "repo": "package-B",
      "version": "v2.3.1-dev"
    }
  ],
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "component-exposed-by-pkg-a"
    },
    {
      "id": "component-exposed-by-pkg-b"
    },
  ],
  "variables": {
    "repoUrl": "https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/cli",
    "copyrightYear": 2023,
    "autoGenerateVehicleModel": true
  }
}
```

The project above will only use the components `component-exposed-by-pkg-a` and `component-exposed-by-pkg-b`, ignoring any other components exposed by the packages.

## File Structure

### `packages` - Array[[`PackageConfig`](#packageconfig)]

Array of packages used in the project.

### `variables` - Map[string, any]

Project-wide key-value variable configuration.

# Types

## `PackageConfig`

### `name` - string

The name of the package or URL to the package git repository. This field is currently resolved to `https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/<name>`. In a future feature addition, we will allow arbitrary git repository URLs in the name field

### `version` - string

The version of the package to use. May be a tag, branch or SHA.

### `variables` - Map[string, any]

Package-wide variable configuration.

### `components` - Array[[`ComponentConfig`](#componentconfig)]

Per-component configuration.

## `ComponentConfig`

### `id` - string

Unique ID of the component within the package.

### `variables` - Map[string, any]

Component-wide key-value variable configuration
